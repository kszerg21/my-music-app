# My Music App

A simple PHP-based web application that lists `.mp3` files from a directory, allowing users to download and play them directly from the browser.

## Features

- Automatic listing of `.mp3` files.
- Files sorted by modification date (newest first).
- Download link and "Play" button for each file.
- Clean table-based layout.

## Usage

Place your `.mp3` files inside the `mp3/` directory. Then run the app using any PHP server (e.g., Apache, Nginx, or the built-in PHP server).

```bash
php -S localhost:8080
